I don't understand bootstrap fully, but my rudimentary understanding is it is a legacy theming that is nearly fully replaced at this point (with lms-main-v1?) but it does still "make the rules" on some very high importance pages like the Course tab. For this reason, you might need to duplicate your rules in bootstrap so that changes appear in both bootstrap and non-bootstrap pages.
